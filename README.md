## Project Focus

The project emphasizes:
- Software architecture and system design
- Persistent storage with crash recovery
- Modular and extensible components
- Multiple access interfaces (API, CLI, Web UI)
- Observability and monitoring support

Machine learning components are integrated as optional enhancements and do not affect the correctness or availability of the core system.
